    answer:
      'We support JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, and SVG for images, plus MP4, WebM, QuickTime (MOV), and AVI for videos. All processing happens in your browser, so your files never leave your device.',

    question: 'Can I upload multiple files at once?',
    answer:
      'Yes! You can upload multiple images and videos simultaneously. Simply select multiple files when clicking "Choose Images or Videos" or drag and drop multiple files into the upload area.

  },
  {
    id: 'watermark-file-size-limits',
    question: 'Are there file size limits?',
    answer:
      'For images, there are no strict size limits, but very large files may take longer to process. For videos, we recommend files under 500MB for optimal performance. You can upload multiple files at once, and all processing happens in your browser.',

  {
    id: 'watermark-what-is',
    question: 'What is watermarking and why do I need it?',
    answer:
      'Watermarking adds text or logo overlays to your images and videos to protect your intellectual property, brand your content, or indicate ownership. It helps prevent unauthorized use of your work while maintaining your professional appearance.',

    id: 'watermark-how-to-use',
    question: 'How do I add a watermark to my images?',

  },
  {
    id: 'watermark-text-vs-logo',
    question: 'Can I use both text and logo watermarks?',
    answer:
      'Currently, you can use either a text watermark OR a logo watermark per image. Choose text for simple copyright notices or logo for brand protection. You can customize both with full control over position, size, opacity, and styling.',
  },
  {
    id: 'watermark-positioning',
    question: 'How do I position my watermark?',
    answer:
      'You can choose from 9 preset positions (top-left, top-center, top-right, middle-left, center, middle-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, bottom-right) or set custom X/Y coordinates for pixel-perfect placement. You can also adjust rotation for diagonal watermarks.',
  },
  {
    id: 'watermark-customization',
    question: 'What can I customize about my watermark?',
    answer:
      'You have complete control! For text watermarks: font family, size, color, opacity, rotation, and position. For logo watermarks: size, opacity, rotation, and position. You can also adjust brightness and contrast to make your watermark stand out or blend in.',
  },
  {
    id: 'watermark-quality',
    question: 'Will watermarking reduce my image quality?',

  },
  {
    id: 'watermark-removal',
    question: 'Can I remove a watermark after adding it?',
    answer:
      'Once a watermark is applied and you download the file, the watermark becomes part of the image or video. To remove it, you would need to use the original file. We recommend keeping your original files as backups before watermarking.',
  },
  {
